	<h2>Saved banjo tabs</h2>
	<p>Date: March 28, 2024</p>
<p><em>This list is updated with archived versions of tabs posted elsewhere. There is a serious problem with linkrot - webpages that can no longer be accessed - for older banjo tablature, this page is an attempt to combat this for songs I have personally collected. The main resource for thes tabs is <a href="www.banjohangout.org">banjohangout</a>, which is a fantastic resource, but it is not a given that this site will be around forever.</em></p>

<p><strong>The Swimming Song, Loudon Wainright III</strong></p>
<p><em>Open-G tuning (g D G B G) - Capo on the 2nd fret</em></p>
<p>Super easy but fun tune, would use a combination of the below tabs and mess around with the accents. It is pretty obvious where these are required.</p>
