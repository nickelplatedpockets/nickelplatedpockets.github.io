	<h2>Archived Tabs</h2>
	<p>Date: March 31st 2024</p>
<p><em>This list is updated with archived versions of tabs posted
elsewhere. There is a serious problem with linkrot - webpages that can
no longer be accessed - for older banjo tablature, this page is an
attempt to combat this for songs I have personally collected. The main
resource for thes tabs is <a
href="www.banjohangout.org">banjohangout</a>, which is a fantastic
resource, but it is not a given that this site will be around
forever.</em></p>

<p><strong>MacPherson’s Rant, Traditional</strong></p>
<p><em>Open-G tuning (g D G B D)</em></p>
<p>There’s a great discussion about the song <a
href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210614061618/">on banjohangout</a>, I
will let that thread do the talking as it has a great background on the
history of the song, a derivative of a famous Robert Burns poem about
outlaw Jamie MacPherson.</p>

Tab, by Janet Burton</a></p>
<p>Note that there is also a great version of the song played by <a
href="https://sorley.bandcamp.com/album/scottish-folk-ballads-of-freedom-ep">Sam
Shackleton</a> that uses the same tuning and progression, with a
strumming style, which is very effective with the vocal line on top.</p>
<p><strong>The Swimming Song, Loudon Wainright III</strong></p>
<p><em>Open-G tuning (g D G B D) - Capo on the 2nd fret</em></p>
<p>Super easy but fun tune, would use a combination of the below tabs
and mess around with the accents. It is pretty obvious where these are
required.</p>

<p><strong>For the Widows in Paradise For the Fatherless in Ypsilanti,
Sufjan Stevens</strong></p>
<p><em>Open-G tuning (g D G B D) - Capo on the 2nd fret</em></p>
<p>Once upon a time, there used to be a website called
<em>AlternativeBanjo</em>, it was a nifty little blog/banjo resource
that sadly has passed on to the other side of the internet. The entire
website has, thankfully, been <a
href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111224223448/http://alternativebanjo.com/">archived</a>
so that we may still enjoy it. It’s tabs are also archived on <a
href="https://github.com/vrish88/altbanjo">github</a> - of which, I have
made a backup in the hopes that they shall always be available. The only
tab that I have had the time to use in practice is “For the Widows…” by
Sufjan Steven. It’s a simple tune played with a strumming/stroke pattern
rather than picked or clawed, but it sounds good, albeit a little
different, when played in a clawhammer style.</p>
