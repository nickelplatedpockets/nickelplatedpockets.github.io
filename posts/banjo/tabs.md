*This list is updated with archived versions of tabs posted elsewhere.
There is a serious problem with linkrot - webpages that can no longer be
accessed - for older banjo tablature, this page is an attempt to combat
this for songs I have personally collected. The main resource for thes
tabs is [banjohangout](www.banjohangout.org), which is a fantastic
resource, but it is not a given that this site will be around forever.*

**MacPherson's Rant, Traditional**

*Open-G tuning (g D G B D)*

There's a great discussion about the song [on banjohangout](http://web.archive.org/web/20210614061618/), I will let that thread do the talking as it has a great background on the history of the song, a derivative of a famous Robert Burns poem about outlaw Jamie MacPherson. 

[Clawhammer Tab, by Janet Burton](http://web.archive.org/web/20230403224134/https://www.mybanjoworld.com/_files/ugd/52786a_4c9625f6a5024445b6a0b0da4fe1c093.pdf)

Note that there is also a great version of the song played by [Sam Shackleton](https://sorley.bandcamp.com/album/scottish-folk-ballads-of-freedom-ep) that uses the same tuning and progression, with a strumming style, which is very effective with the vocal line on top.



**The Swimming Song, Loudon Wainright III**

*Open-G tuning (g D G B D) - Capo on the 2nd fret*

Super easy but fun tune, would use a combination of the below tabs and
mess around with the accents. It is pretty obvious where these are
required.

**For the Widows in Paradise For the Fatherless in Ypsilanti, Sufjan Stevens**

*Open-G tuning (g D G B D) - Capo on the 2nd fret*

Once upon a time, there used to be a website called *AlternativeBanjo*, it was a nifty little blog/banjo resource that sadly has passed on to the other side of the internet. The entire website has, thankfully, been [archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20111224223448/http://alternativebanjo.com/) so that we may still enjoy it. It's tabs are also archived on [github](https://github.com/vrish88/altbanjo) - of which, I have made a backup in the hopes that shall always be available. The only tab that I have had the time to use in practice is "For the Widows..." by Sufjan Steven. It's a simple tune played with a strumming/stroke pattern rather than picked or clawed, but it sounds good, albeit a little different, when played in a clawhammer style.
